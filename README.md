  ## What is Meal Ordeal?
  Meal Ordeal is an action/adventure life-sim inspired by Homestuck, Stardew Valley and Moonlighter. It's a resource management game with elements of combat and slice-of-life NPC interactions. The main protagonist of the games is one **JESS BROOKS**. She's in a hilarious amount of debt, and it's up to the player to get out of that debt. To do so, the player will work at a sandwich shop, which actively risks its employees' health and safety in name of quality service.
